		#autoLOC_900077 = This moon was especially hard to spot, as it looks just like a pollen grain, particularly when observed through telescopes based near dusty fields.\n\nPol was finally discovered when someone decided to write down the location of the pollen, after having given up on yet another failed attempt to be rid of the smudge.
		#autoLOC_910001 = Bop is a small moon in the vicinity of Jool. In Kerbal mythology, Bop is believed to be the home of the Kraken, a mischievous creature said to play with the ships of hapless explorers, by spinning them out of control until torn asunder, then casting them into oblivion.
		#autoLOC_900080 = Tylo was the first moon of Jool to be discovered by the Kerbal Astronomical Society. After many failed attempts to take a flawless picture of Jool to hang on the office walls, it was finally discovered that the wandering white smear was indeed a moon.\n\nScientists speculate that the view from the surface with Laythe, Vall and Jool overhead must be “quite something”.
		#autoLOC_900082 = Vall was one of the last Moons of Jool to be discovered. Frustrated scientists kept attempting to wipe it off the lenses of their telescopes. Eventually after a rash of returned telescopes, Advanced Optics Co. finally decided to just tell them it was an actual object in the sky.
		#autoLOC_900084 = When Laythe was first discovered, it was not entered in the records because the scientist in charge thought he was looking at Kerbin.\n\nLuckily this error was corrected when a plucky intern informed him that “telescopes don’t work that way”.\n\nThe intern was shortly afterwards “promoted” and moved to the experimental rocket testing program.
		#autoLOC_900086 = Ike is a relatively large, grey object occasionally seen orbiting Duna. Scientists have postulated that Ike is seemingly perfectly positioned to sneakily interfere with any object that presumes to come orbiting near its parent.
		#autoLOC_900088 = Minmus is the smallest moon orbiting Kerbin. From the surface of Kerbin, it can be seen on clear days as a tiny blue speck in the sky. \n\nIt is often mistaken as dirt on telescope lenses or dead pixels, but the top minds at the Kerbal Astronomical Society assure us it is a real moon nevertheless.
		#autoLOC_900090 = The Mun, is a large satellite orbiting Kerbin. It is mostly gray in appearance, with craters of various sizes dotting its otherwise smooth surface.\n\nThe Mun’s discovery is widely regarded as one of the more important breakthroughs of Kerbal evolution. Granted, it didn’t happen all that long ago, but it’s still fair to say Kerbals are wiser and more evolved now than they were back then.
		#autoLOC_900092 = Gilly is a lumpy rock wandering around the orbit of Eve. It’s by far the smallest natural satellite that the Kerbal Astronomical Society has discovered.\n\nDue to the large amount of squinting and eye strain associated with its discovery, wearing glasses has now become synonymous with being an accomplished Astronomer.
		#autoLOC_900094 = There’s been a considerable amount of controversy around the status of Eeloo as being a proper planet or a just “lump of ice going around the Sun”. The debate is still ongoing, since most academic summits held to address the issue have devolved into, on good days, petty name calling, and on worse ones, all-out brawls.
		#autoLOC_900096 = Jool is particularly known for being a rather large, predominantly green planet. Kerbalkind has longed to visit it since it was first spotted in the sky. Philosophers reason that the swirling green planet must be a really nice place to visit, on account of its wholesome coloration.\n\nIf you look at Jool through a telescope, it is fuzzy.
		#autoLOC_900098 = Dres is a very small planet. It was the first planet considered to be a dwarf. It’s orbit is highly irregular and together with it’s size it took a long time to discover since half the time it was not where scientists expected to find a planet.\n\nDue to its nature of frequenting the bad parts of space. This dwarf planet was officially labeled as “Not to be trusted” by the scientific community.
		#autoLOC_900100 = Also known as the red dot that you can see if you squint at it really hard, Duna has long been a wonder to Kerbalkind. The planet has been held in much awe, due to its striking red color and stark contrast to the color green.
		#autoLOC_900101 = A unique world, Kerbin has flat plains, soaring mountains and wide, blue oceans. Home to the Kerbals, it has just the right conditions to support a vast, seemingly undepletable population of the eager green creatures.\n\nReaching a stable orbit around Kerbin is one of the first things budding space programs strive for. It is said that those who can get their ship into orbit are halfway to anywhere.
		#autoLOC_900103 = Eve is certainly the purplest object in the solar system. It’s one of the larger, most visible objects, mainly because of its very, very purple tint.\n\nIt is considered by some to be almost a sister planet to Kerbin. Well, despite the purple, and the toxic atmosphere, and the extreme press- ures and temperatures. Actually, it’s not very similar at all is it? Who are those people?
		#autoLOC_900105 = Moho figures in Kerbal mythology as a fiery place with oceans of flowing lava. In reality however, it’s much less interesting. \n\nScientists speculate about possible ways to make it “awesome like in the stories”. Some of those ideas have led to new breakthroughs in aerospace technology.
		#autoLOC_910002 = The Sun is the most well known object in the daytime sky. Scientists have noted a particular burning sensation and potential loss of vision if it is stared at for long periods of time. This is especially important to keep in mind considering the effect shiny objects have on the average Kerbal.
		#autoLOC_900108 = At the Runway, spacecraft built in the Spaceplane Hangar have a long flat surface to reach take-off speed. Conceivably, such aircraft could even land back on it.
		#autoLOC_900112 = At the Mission Control Facility, all available Contracts can be managed. It also offers a very nice view of the launch sites, for any who are brave enough to be so close to a launching craft.
		#autoLOC_900114 = The Spaceplane Hangar allows construction of spacecraft designed to be launched from the Runway.
		#autoLOC_900116 = The Launchpad is where vessels built at the VAB are launched. We are reasonably confident it's at a safe enough distance from everything else.
		#autoLOC_900119 = Flag Pole
		#autoLOC_900120 = This is the official flag of the Space Program... Or we could change it.
		#autoLOC_900122 = At the Tracking Station, all ongoing missions can be viewed and focused. Landed craft can be recovered from here as well.
		#autoLOC_900124 = The Astronaut Complex contains the living and recreation spaces for all our crewmembers. New applicants also apply here to be recruited.
		#autoLOC_900125 = The VAB is where spacecraft are designed and built, before being moved over to the Launchpad for flight.
		#autoLOC_900127 = At the R&D Facility, our team of scientists works hard to crunch the data received from mission experiments. Here, all researched technologies can be viewed, and new ones discovered.
		#autoLOC_900129 = The Administration Building may not seem like a very exciting place at first, but here is where all our strategic decisions are made.
