		#autoLOC_500000 = NA
		#autoLOC_500001 = Dinkelstein Kerman has become somewhat of a legend in the spacecraft industry, not least impressively because he vehemently claims to have been constructing and flying spaceships long before the first actual recorded instance of any such vehicle being assembled. This has led to some controversy and a lot of awkwardness between him and the Kerbin World-Firsts Record-Keeping Society. Be that as it may, Dinklestein's Emporium is still generally well regarded as a traditional, old-fashioned company, and their products are actually a lot less rusty than the company's owner.
		#autoLOC_500002 = The Experimental Engineering Group is a typical startup company: Low budgets and impossibly tight deadlines are part of a normal working day for them. Despite being such a young company however, Experimental Engineering has made a good start, quickly making a name for themselves in the industry, mainly thanks to their very educational and entertaining SC-9001 Science Jr. Experiment Kit. Despite valiant efforts from their representatives, however, they haven't quite been able to shake off the bad press that followed some leaked footage of an incident involving one of their units and a small critter that one of the scientists over at R&D used to keep as a pet. Some say the incident has made them extremely concerned with the safety of anything that approach their products. They've even rounded out the edges on their company logo.
		#autoLOC_500003 = FLOOYD Labs is a company focused on doing one thing, and doing it as well as is conceivably possible to do it: Displacing liquids from one place to another. Their flagship product, the FTX-2 Fuel Duct, is the final result of years of research and development and endless Kerbal-hours of effort to produce a device that will pump any amount of just about anything, no matter how cold, dense or volatile it is. The company enjoys a well-deserved reputation for such an important contribution to the industry, and most agree that these days, almost nobody remembers the embarrassment of their recall of the FTX-1 series, which had a small but highly problematic issue, that while it did pump fluids flawlessly, it pumped them in the wrong direction.
		#autoLOC_500004 = NA
		#autoLOC_500005 = What this small company lacks in experience and reputation, it makes up for in the sheer ambitiousness of their projects. Their first product was the very massive Mobile Processing Lab, which rumour has it was first developed as a mobile processing facility to secretly brew an experimental, possibly illegal fuel mixture, which was reportedly far more potent than the currently available propellants, and had a distinctive blue tint to it. Those rumours have never been proven however, and this mysterious blue propellant has yet to be seen by a reliable source. Despite their repeated attempts to be rid of these rumours, the company still suffers from a (probably undeserved) bad reputation. They try to offset this initial impression by offering much larger cash payoffs than other companies of similar size, which admittedly does very little to improve their current image.
		#autoLOC_500006 = One of the leading names in spacecraft electronics, and not just because the name itself sounds so cool. Ionic Symphonic Protonic Electronics has a large catalogue of components, ranging from simple comms devices to seriously cutting edge gear. This has made their products quite popular among aerospace engineers, and also nurtured a profound enmity from the pragmatic folks at Probodobodyne.
		#autoLOC_500007 = It is universally agreed that Jeb's Junkyard is one the best examples of the triumph of unwavering motivation in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds. The unassuming junkyard where it is said some of Kerbalkind's first steps towards the depths of space have been taken, has now become a much larger junkyard, as it had to expand its facilities to accommodate the ever greater demand for spacecraft components. Jeb's Junkyard has become one of Kerbin's most iconic names, becoming far more than just a beloved brand. It now stands proudly as a symbol of the unstoppable Kerbal drive towards attempting the impossible while grossly underestimating the gravity of the situation.
		#autoLOC_500008 = NA
		#autoLOC_500009 = An institution completely devoted to the tracking and curating all first instances of any event, the Kerbin World-Firsts Record-Keeping Society is a  non-profit organization, for the purpose of rewarding the doing of anything that's never been done before, especially concerning feats of space exploration. Their work is more challenging than it would seem however, as the prestige associated with the first-ever accomplishment of any deed is also a valuable target for commercial companies, who wouldn't waste the opportunity to be the official sponsor of such an event. Taking on the Society's contracts will definitely send the message that you're not in it for the money, which is always a good message to send. It's also just about the only reward, since the cash prizes are mostly symbolic.
		#autoLOC_500010 = Although Kerbodyne is a relatively new name in the aerospace industry, their K series engines and fuel tanks have earned them a quite a reputation in a short amount of time. So much so in fact, that Kerbodyne was nominated for the "Best Debut" Award, at last year's Spacecraft Developers Convention. Unfortunately, that prize went to another company, but Kerbodyne fans are known to demonstrate loudly and publicly, their appreciation for the company and its products.
		#autoLOC_500011 = Kerlington has a long history of introducing ground-breaking new technologies, many of which are now considered indispensable for rocketry and aerospace engineering. This has fostered a strong community of loyal Kerlington fans, as well as a similarly large group of disgruntled competitors.
		#autoLOC_500012 = NA
		#autoLOC_500013 = The Moving Parts Experts Group started off as a mostly non-commercial initiative to bring some of the brightest minds together to create truly innovative and ground-breaking technologies for spacecraft construction. As is the case with many such enterprises, their initial investment funds very soon ran out and they were forced to start developing stuff that they could sell, quickly. As a result, the Group acquired a reputation for being always in a hurry, and always strapped for cash. They still try their best to stay true to their original motivations as much as possible though, and will always be willing to support any ventures that push the currently established boundaries.
		#autoLOC_500014 = For a company that made a reputation by creating as much destruction as possible, O.M.B. has found a remarkably suitable place for its highly volatile devices in the aerospace industry. Their precision Decouplers are second to none when the job calls for splitting spacecraft into multiple smaller ones. Some of their other demolition products however, despite being heavily advertised as far more powerful disassembly tools, weren't nearly as successful. O.M.B. is still unsure as to why those "clearly better" products weren't so well received.
		#autoLOC_500015 = NA
		#autoLOC_500016 = Probodobodyne was at one point one of the leading (and few) names in the industry. Over the years though, the company has fallen behind the times somewhat, but they continue to maintain their philosophy that space exploration should be the privilege of the few who can overcome the challenges of conquering it, with minimal technological assistance. Their products reflect that pragmatic and arguably obsolete outlook, even in spite of the many newer companies that are coming up around them with alternatives that make space travel far more accessible than it was back in the "early days". Despite all this, the company has retained a small but loyal following of hardcore fans, who live by their vision of a very selective industry, populated only by the very best astronauts and engineers.
		#autoLOC_500017 = The Space Program's own Research & Development Department. Headed by celebrity rocket scientist Wernher von Kerman, these guys are the brains of the whole operation. Driven by an unquenchable thirst for knowledge, no piece of data is too small or too irrelevant, and increasing the accumulated knowledge of Kerbalkind is their main motivation. Our resident geniuses only ask to be given due academic credit for their contributions to science, and that all astronauts PLEASE refrain from entering the labs without cleaning their boots first.
		#autoLOC_500018 = Reaction Systems is a small company, which enjoyed a reasonable amount of success with their one successful product, the Place-Anywhere Linear RCS Port. These days, nobody knows for certain what they're working on. Even though Reaction Systems is most definitely not the largest company out there, they try to make up for it by supporting all pioneering endeavours. Also, their eagerness to offer science-gathering contracts lends credit to speculation that they may be up to something.
		#autoLOC_500019 = Indisputably the largest supplier of rocketry components out there, Rockomax products are widely regarded as the most accessible way to get into space. This has earned them a somewhat negative reputation among the more posh or avant-garde engineers, some even outright refusing to admit to having used Rockomax-Brand products. Be that as it may, Rockomax's gigantic presence in the industry cannot be gainsaid, and their products are actually pretty good value, even if they do lack that 'trendy' feel of the more up-scale rocketry brands. They are a massively large corporation, so don't expect them to cut you very special deals. They are already giving all their customers a bulk discount, plus their 'super-value' deals when using products from their partner brands. All this provided, of course, that you have your membership card with you when you go shopping at their warehouses.
		#autoLOC_500020 = Rokea is mainly known for their 'vertical mobility enhancer' products, which they go to great lengths to ensure are not mistaken by simplistic 'ladders'. Some say they are failing miserably in that effort, even though every Rokea representative will very eagerly educate all who come within earshot about the differences between ladders and a vertical mobility enhancement device. Perhaps this communications strategy is part of the reason nobody cares.
		#autoLOC_500021 = Many question the reasoning behind Sean's Cannery's -known for their very excellent canned foods products- incursion into the aerospace engineering world. Despite the criticism, none can dispute that their flagship product, the Lander Can Mk1 Cockpit, has proven itself many times over as a reliable and perhaps not surprisingly, one of the most air-tight crew carrying modules available today. Lander Can crews often praise the module for its ability to keep stowed snacks crisp and fresh, and complain of how on other pods they become mushy after just a few days into the mission.
		#autoLOC_500022 = STEADLER is not known for being a very kind or yielding company. Rather, militaristic, stern and uncompromising are much more fitting adjectives to describe them. Some say these are good qualities for a company responsible mainly for engineering control systems for rockets and hypersonic aircraft, while others suggest that the company is actually being run by a rogue Guidance Module that achieved sentience. All we really know is that their gate security is much too Temperamental to allow for any observation, and that their stun guns recharge very quickly.
		#autoLOC_500023 = One of the largest manufacturers of structural components for any purpose, StrutCo is by all measures a very well-established company. The only thing they have never been able to get over is the fact that the legendary EAS-4 Strut Connector itself was actually invented by Kerlington Model Rockets.
		#autoLOC_500024 = Vac-Co is a relatively new name in the industry. With previous experience only as a manufacturer of housecleaning equipment and small appliances, their recent venture into aerospace engineering has been met with no small amount of skepticism. Nevertheless, they seem to know what they're doing, as their products have been quite innovative in the air intakes for spaceplanes sector.
		#autoLOC_500025 = WinterOwl is by no means comparable to other large aircraft companies in terms of sheer number of products they offer. However, the company is one of the best-known names in the industry as it's one of the oldest companies in operation. This has earned them a reputation for being a friendly, reliable partner, which means they have good standings with many other companies. In the aerospace circles, it is considered very poor manners to be rude about WinterOwl or its products.
		#autoLOC_500026 = Zaltonics isn't exactly known as a strong leader in the electronic components industry, rather more as a somewhat utilitarian company that lacks a certain amount of ambition. These traits however, have made Zaltonic indispensable in their own way, as they are willing to take on the manufacturing of the less exciting devices, and they've become quite good at doing that in a quick and cost-effective way. Their products might not be all the rage, but when your fancy remote guidance unit runs out of juice, chances are you'll be using a Zaltonics battery to keep it powered.

		#autoLOC_500112 = A.I.R.B.R.A.K.E.S
		#autoLOC_500113 = Research into feasible ways to slow down a plane in mid-air showed that loose hull panels are pretty great as drag-inducing deceleration devices. The discovery led to the invention of the Aerodynamically Integrated Retrograde Braking Robustly Armed Kinetic Extending System (A.I.R.B.R.A.K.E.S.), which is now popular mostly as a cheap alternative to longer runways. C7 Engineers are still trying to come up with a shorter name for such a long acronym.

		#autoLOC_500286 = Advanced Reaction Wheel Module, Large
		#autoLOC_500287 = After many years of research, STEADLER Corps rocket engineers discovered that large flywheels were necessary to keep large ships under control. The "Advanced Reaction Wheel Module, Large" addresses that issue by its use of patented Large Flywheels™ to provide "More Torque" (patent pending). STEADLER promptly dismissed all criticism concerning the necessity of so much research work, stating that 'it only sounds so simple now that we've figured it out'. Critics remain skeptical, but none can disagree that this module does indeed pack a lot more punch than previous models. It also needs a lot more power, but STEADLER is currently carrying out intense research work on why that is.

		#autoLOC_500329 = After extensive research and testing to improve the safety factor of next-generation modules for their Mk2 series, engineers at C7 Aerospace got fed up with having to constantly find new recruits willing to test their prototypes, and decided to develop an autonomous AI capable of doing the same job, only with a lot less screaming over the comms link. This was met with divided opinions, some criticizing C7 as taking the "booooring" route, others praising them for the innovation, while yet others reacted by shutting themselves in bunkers in anticipation of the time when these units will gain sentience and turn on their creators.

		#autoLOC_500338 = QBE is Probodobodyne's latest development in probe miniaturization. Despite it's diminutive size, the QBE is a fully-functional and incredibly lightweight command unit. All this goodness comes at a price however: The QBE's tiny enclosure means there is no room for internal reaction wheels, and battery capacity is pitiful at best. Despite all this, or perhaps because of it, many engineers have found it to be ideally suited for those 'optional return' missions.

		#autoLOC_500358 = Probodobodyne Stayputnik
		#autoLOC_500359 = The Stayputnik offers the ultimate solution in crew safety. A lightweight sphere equipped with remote receivers and relay control input from the ground to the craft, it carries no crew at all, thus keeping them perfectly safe from all harm. This device does require electricity to operate however, and will cease to function if the power runs out. The built-in batteries should keep it going for about 10 minutes.
		#autoLOC_500360 = command control (core kerbnet probe satellite space steer
		#autoLOC_500361 = FTX-2 External Fuel Duct
		#autoLOC_500362 = New breakthroughs at FLOOYD Dynamics have made the FTX Fuel Duct a reality. Altough criticized by some as being no more than 'a sewage pipe painted yellow', most agree that the yellow is a relatively nice color, and that fuel lines are indeed able to pump fuel from side-mounted fuel tanks. After the recall of the FTX-1 series, All FTX-2 lines have arrows painted on to indicate the fuel flow direction, so engineers can tell which way around they are supposed to go.

		#autoLOC_500457 = S3 KS-25 "Vector" Liquid Fuel Engine
		#autoLOC_500458 = Kerbodyne's flagship engine, the KS-25 excels as a first stage engine through its high thrust-to-weight ratio and exceptional sea level efficiency. Kerbodyne engineers achieved this by running the engine in a staged combustion cycle and at extremely high chamber pressures. Special new alloys had to be invented to suppress the engine's tendency to become a bomb. The single version is designed with very durable components and high reusability, as well as higher gimbal range, but because of that is also heavier than its expendable counterpart used in first stage clusters.

		#autoLOC_500466 = O-10 "Puff" MonoPropellant Fuel Engine
		#autoLOC_500467 = When The O-10 Engine was first unveiled, it was regarded as one of those ideas that someone should have thought of a long time ago. This made most employees at Reaction Systems Ltd feel quite awkward, as they were particularly proud of having delivered this project on schedule for once. This Engine responds to main throttle controls, but it consumes MonoPropellant instead of a Fuel+Oxidizer mix.

		#autoLOC_500469 = CR-7 R.A.P.I.E.R. Engine
		#autoLOC_500470 = The R.A.P.I.E.R. (Reactive Alternate-Propellant Intelligent Engine for Rockets) is a joint venture between C7 Aerospace and the Rockomax Conglomerate. Designed to fill a gap in the design requirements for sustainable single stage to orbit aircraft, this engine combines the best of rocket and air-breathing thrust technology.

		#autoLOC_500472 = LFB KR-1x2 "Twin-Boar" Liquid Fuel Engine
		#autoLOC_500473 = This liquid fuel booster system is a very purposeful piece of engineering. Instead of relying on single engines or solid rocket boosters, the KR-1x2 employs two modified KR-1 engine, fed by a built-in fuel system, as the source of its immense lifting power. All that self-contained goodness comes at the cost of not having a mounting point for its underside, and not being quite as efficient as dedicated engines. It also comes at quite a literal cost as well.
		#autoLOC_500474 = ascent (boar booster main propuls rocket (twin
		#autoLOC_500475 = Kerbodyne KR-2L+ "Rhino" Liquid Fuel Engine
		#autoLOC_500476 = This engine is Kerbodyne's first attempt at a highly advanced engine. The engineers couldn't get it to produce full efficiency at sea level without the engine exploding, so it was repurposed as an upper stage engine. The experience gained here with high efficiency has been repurposed for later models, which feature multiple combustion chambers at higher pressure (that don't go boom). This engine is optimized for lighting mid-flight, although it still provides respectable power at sea level.
		#autoLOC_500477 = ascent main propuls (rhino rocket sustain vacuum
		#autoLOC_500478 = S3 KS-25x4 "Mammoth" Liquid Fuel Engine
		#autoLOC_500479 = Kerbodyne engineers got fed up with having to contend with overly complicated staging arrays for lifting heavy payloads, and decided instead to just build a truly enormous engine of the highest efficiency. Strapping together four of Kerbodyne's KS-25 rocket motors in a single assembly, they created the largest rocket engine in production anywhere, and each KS-25 has the highest chamber pressure--the reason for four small nozzles and combustion chambers, not one big one (those kept going boom). It's certainly got the power to match its size, and although it excels in its main role as a first-stage engine, the lack of structural hardpoints on its underside makes it quite less suitable for other purposes. Its price tag also seems to match its size, in fact.

		#autoLOC_500487 = RT-5 "Flea" Solid Fuel Booster
		#autoLOC_500488 = While considered by some to be little more than "a trash bin full o' boom", The RT-5 can be seen in use at many space programs, perhaps possibly because it is the only option for many space programs, but nevertheless, this small booster provides a nice kick to lift small payloads to considerable heights. Use with caution, though. Once lit, solid fuel motors cannot be put out until the fuel runs out.

		#autoLOC_500493 = Vernor Engine
		#autoLOC_500494 = The VR-N1ER Veer-Governor, or "Vernor" Engine is an attitude control thruster. These motors are linked to RCS controls, but are powered by a Fuel+Oxidizer mix, making them significantly more powerful than MonoPropellant-powered RCS thrusters. They are fairly more bulky in comparison though, and feature only one nozzle facing outwards, although most agree that is an acceptable trade-off for the additional punch they pack.

		#autoLOC_500529 = FL-T200 Fuel Tank
		#autoLOC_500530 = The T200 tank had some difficulty being accepted in the spacecraft engineering world, because most rocket builders had trouble overcoming their urges to squee at the "cute little fuel tank". This initial reaction was only put aside when the amount of fiery explosions in assembly areas became so high, strict guidelines were put in place to prohibit "teasing the fuel containers". The T200 Tank now is widely used in several space programs and does a remarkably good job, if assembled politely.
		#autoLOC_500531 = fueltank ?lfo liquid oxidizer propellant rocket
		#autoLOC_500532 = FL-T400 Fuel Tank
		#autoLOC_500533 = The FL series was received as a substantial upgrade over previous fuel containers used in the Space Program, generally due to its ability to keep the fuel unexploded more often than not. Fuel tanks are useless if there isn't a Liquid Engine attached under it. They can also be stacked with other fuel tanks to increase the amount of fuel for the engine below.

		#autoLOC_501147 = Linus is Wernher Von Kerman's Intern. Because Wernher himself is too important to be bothered with these boring strategy meetings. He sends his intern in his stead.
		#autoLOC_501148 = Walt Kerman is the spokesperson for the Space Program. He wears a hazmat suit. Which isn't strictly required for his job, but it seems appropriate for someone working in such a toxic environment.
		#autoLOC_501149 = Gus Kerman is head of Space Program Operations and all-around repairs guy whenever something around here breaks down, and he's the reason why all our pods have windows.
		#autoLOC_501150 = Appreciation Campaign
		#autoLOC_501151 = We could definitely improve our image by putting some effort into reminding Kerbals everywhere of just how great the Space Program is. Advertisement space isn't free, however.
		#autoLOC_501152 = Fundraising Campaign
		#autoLOC_501153 = We can likely raise some money by exploiting the attention that we get out of new successful ventures to remind the well-to-do Kerbals out there that we could use their support, and the contents of their wallets. This is probably going to be seen as a bit cheeky of us, so be prepared to face some backlash from the public.
		#autoLOC_501154 = Open-Source Tech Program
		#autoLOC_501155 = Even though we went through great lengths to get our scientific data, making it available for free to all of Kerbalkind can only be seen as a good thing. R&D will probably not be at its peak efficiency however, with all the noise these outside opinions tend to generate.
		#autoLOC_501156 = Unpaid Research Program
		#autoLOC_501157 = A program where undergrad researchers are given the opportunity to work in our great Space Program, to boost the science earned out of each mit of data.

		#autoLOC_501158 = Outsourced R&D
		#autoLOC_501159 = Why do all the data-crunching ourselves when we can contract external research labs to help us process the data we receive. These services aren't exactly cheap, but their R&D facilities are very impressive.
		#autoLOC_501160 = Patents Licensing
		#autoLOC_501161 = Our science data can be worth a lot of money by selling licenses for other organizations to use our patents. The added book-keeping required will probably add some extra work for the R&D team, but the financial benefits could be worth their reduced output.
		#autoLOC_501162 = Aggressive Negotiations
		#autoLOC_501163 = We can get better deals with our suppliers by taking up a more... assertive stance on our negotiations with them. They probably won't see this as a friendly move, but we can definitely have it our way if we press them. It's not as if we care what others think, do we?
		#autoLOC_501164 = Recovery Transponder Fitting
		#autoLOC_501165 = Recovering parts landed far away from the Space Center can be very costly, but I reckon we can reduce those costs by installing better transponders on the parts we launch. These units are not cheap, but they should make it much easier to find parts, improving the recovery value even if they're half-way around Kerbin. What do you say?
		#autoLOC_501166 = Bail-Out Grant
		#autoLOC_501167 = We must be in dire straits to be considering such an option. Accepting a public grant could save us from bankruptcy, but it would also put a very serious dent in the Space Program's reputation. However, the Space Program is too big to fail, so if it's either this option or closing shop, I would advise you to accept the money.
		#autoLOC_501168 = Research Rights Sell-Out
		#autoLOC_501169 = We could make a quick buck from the Science the R&D team has collected by selling exclusive research rights to the highest bidder. Yes, that means we wouldn't be able to make use of that Science ourselves, but for exclusive rights, I'm sure we could fetch a pretty penny from some large agency or conglomerate.
		#autoLOC_501170 = Leadership Initiative
		#autoLOC_501171 = If we focus our efforts on consistently pushing our own space program forward, we can drum up more public interest. We will need to put a few contracts on the backburner, so we may have to start selling research rights to the academic community to stay solvent.

		#autoLOC_501173 = A starting craft. Can be built from the start of a career game, and is good enough to let you advance. Cheap, too!

		#autoLOC_501175 = The Aeris 3A is a small and nimble one-seater plane, mostly used as a training craft for fixed-wing flight, and to annoy ground staff by 'buzzing' the space center facilities. ¨¨
		#autoLOC_501176 = Aeris 4A
		#autoLOC_501177 = The Aeris 4A is a spaceplane capable of reaching orbit, if flown correctly.¨¨
		#autoLOC_501178 = Albatross 3
		#autoLOC_501179 = The Albatross 3 is a low-speed, long-range aircraft, capable of stable sustained flight for hours on end. ¨¨Its very long wings will flex quite a bit, but the flight operations handbook says that's "most likely normal".¨¨It also recommends always using rudder and ailerons combined to turn it.¨
		#autoLOC_501180 = Bug-E Buggy
		#autoLOC_501181 = Bug-E is built to boldly go where no Kerman has gone before...¨EZ Attach Decoupler Included for quick integration to transport Vehicle.¨Warranty Void if used at nighttime.
		#autoLOC_501182 = Crater Crawler
		#autoLOC_501183 = While the Crater Crawler can be used on Kerbin if you're gentle, it really shines on a low G moon such as the Mun, where the built in thrusters allow an unparalleled level of manoeuvrability.

		#autoLOC_501185 = A Prototype Spaceplane capable of reaching Orbit. It has not yet been outfitted with any mission equipment.
		#autoLOC_501186 = Gull
		#autoLOC_501187 = A small and light seaplane, the Gull makes an excellent basic trainer for kerbals who aren't exactly sure when or where they will be landing (or "landing"). It can take off and land at shockingly low speeds (slower than some hotrodded rovers seen being driven around KSC by certain unnamed test pilots) thanks to its inner-wing flaps.
		#autoLOC_501188 = Mallard
		#autoLOC_501189 = The Mallard is a large seaplane with twin high-efficiency turbofans mounted high on the fuselage to clear the spray. It is somewhat slow but very steady in flight. A full suite of flaps on the trailing edges of the main wings give it exceptional low-speed lift, and small hydroplane steps mounted on each side of the fuselage bottom help lift it out of the water (lowering water drag) during takeoff runs. Its entire fuselage, absent the cockpit forward, is one long cargobay, with a ramp at the tail end. This allows rovers (and boats) to come aboard or leave while the Mallard is landed. It's a bit low on fuel, so you might consider adding some to the cargo bay for long flights, or make them at high altitude.
		#autoLOC_501190 = Osprey
		#autoLOC_501191 = A high-performance (and high-risk) seaplane, the Osprey is designed for those daredevils who don't want to sacrifice performance but still want to be able to land anywhere wet or dry on Kerbin. The afterburning Panther turbofan provides high efficiency in dry mode and high thrust in wet mode, perfect for strolls and sprints both.¨¨The outriggers have a hydroplane stretching between them, allowing the Osprey to "step up" during its takeoff run in the water, massively lowering drag. Once you step up, it's safe to take off. The outriggers are jettisonable, but they have the landing gear too. So don't stage away the outriggers unless you're planning one final water landing, however (or one very final indeed land "landing").
		#autoLOC_501192 = Prospector Rover
		#autoLOC_501193 = General Purpose Open Vacuum Rover for all your prospecting needs!¨Fuel Cell Power system for KM's of Range. ¨Prospecting Science Package standard, and plenty of room for expansion on the Flatbed.¨Manufacturer recommends keeping brown parts facing ground.
		#autoLOC_501194 = Ravenspear Mk1
		#autoLOC_501195 = The first model of the Ravenspear series of fast, high-altitude aircraft, the Mk1 is fitted with three engines: One central one that is most efficient at low speeds, and two afterburning turbofans that are almost as efficient in dry thrust but provide quite a kick (at quite a cost) in wet mode.¨¨Its canard design has been called "very flyable, actually" by a few famous test pilots, although they also warn of the tendency to strike the tail on takeoff if pulling up too eagerly. Although they remark "it's good that there are more engines, if you break that middle one".
		#autoLOC_501196 = Ravenspear Mk3
		#autoLOC_501197 = The Ravenspear Mk3 is a longer-range high-altitude spaceplane, with a novel wing geometry that provides large amounts of lift at high altitudes. ¨¨It is capable of sub-orbital flights, which makes it a decent test platform for high-altitude experimental engines and other such sciency things.
		#autoLOC_501198 = Ravenspear Mk4
		#autoLOC_501199 = The Mk4 marks a bit of a change in direction from previous Ravenspear models. ¨¨Instead of focusing on high-altitude flight, the Mk4 is primarily geared towards making the most out of its four afterburning turbofans. In dry mode, however, it is capable of considerable range.¨¨Being capable of very high-speed flight at low altitudes, it's a favorite among the bravest test pilots, and quite the opposite for the not-so-brave ones.¨
		#autoLOC_501200 = Rocket-power VTOL
		#autoLOC_501201 = This craft is an experimental test platform for rocket-powered flight. ¨¨Used primarily in training pilots to land on places where parachute descents aren't an option, it's also found a use in telling the ace pilots apart from the 'ok' ones, by the simple expedient of putting them in one of these, and calling "Ace" any that make it out afterwards.
		#autoLOC_501202 = Satellite Launcher
		#autoLOC_501203 = A conventional jet equipped with a small rocket to demonstrate feasibility of rocket launches from high altitude.
		#autoLOC_501204 = Skywinder AE1
		#autoLOC_501205 = The Skywinder AE1 is a sleek and agile plane that was originally used in air races and stunt shows sponsored by Green Kraken energy snacks. The front canards, thrust reversers, and built in safety parachute allowed daredevils to perform all sorts of creative maneuvers that sensible pilots would never even consider! ¨¨Following a series of unfortunate events, it has since been donated to the space center for recreational use.
		#autoLOC_501206 = Stearwing A300
		#autoLOC_501207 = The Stearwing A300 is a large aircraft, built to carry heavy payloads and a large number of passengers. Don't expect it to reach very impressive altitudes or speeds though. Wings may shear off under excessive stress. Warranty does not cover damage from attempted aerobatics.
		#autoLOC_501208 = Stratolauncher
		#autoLOC_501209 = A Large drone plane designed to carry a rocket to an altitude of 10km and launch it from there. The drone can then theoretically return to the runway to be reused, provided avionics work.
		#autoLOC_501210 = Thunderbird
		#autoLOC_501211 = The Thunderbird is a muscle-car of an aircraft. Broadly similar in performance to the Osprey, it lacks the Osprey's graceful lines (and abilities as a seaplane) in exchange for a higher top speed. Indeed the Thunderbird is basically an engine with a cockpit and some wings bolted on...and therefore a huge success with the test pilots. Make sure you drop the droptanks when they empty to achieve best speed!
		#autoLOC_501212 = Velociteze
		#autoLOC_501213 = A small personnel transport using two small basic jets. Nowhere as efficient as turbofans, they nonetheless provide sterling service in this role (and are far less thirsty than an afterburner or turboramjet). The Velociteze is a well-tempered aircraft, fit for trainees versed on the Gull and Aeris 3A who want to step up to a multi-engine aircraft (and do some useful service ferrying passengers besides).
		#autoLOC_501214 = AeroEquus
		#autoLOC_501215 = The flying four legged neighing landcreature.¨¨Legend has it that the Equus can be ridden by brave Kerbals, all we know is that it takes a brave Kerbal to ride this four booster beast past the Mun, or if really foolhardy, past Minmus.
		#autoLOC_501216 = ComSat Lx
		#autoLOC_501217 = Tiny satalite with antenna and solar power?¨Launcher to bring it to space?¨¨Done and Done!
		#autoLOC_501218 = Dynawing
		#autoLOC_501219 = The Dynawing is a partially-reusable shuttle based around the Dynawing orbiter (with two KS25 engines) and an external tank to feed them, boosted by two Kickbacks. Hailed as the "next generation" of cheap access to space, with a payload of up to 16 tons (reference payload included), it is somewhat tricky to fly, as expensive as conventional rockets, and Kraken help you if something explodes on ascent. But it looks great, very futuristic. Flight crews are, of course, queuing up.¨¨The main engines fire roughly through the center of mass. Fly an inverted ascent with the shuttle on the 'down' side of the stack, and lead the prograde vector a bit. It's designed to use up all External Tank propellant on the first burn, horizontal by 45 km and keep burning to end up in a 75 x 0 km "orbit" or so. Then stage away  the tank, press 6 to disable the main engines, stage again to ignite the OMS engines, and use them to circularize and later deorbit. Fly a high-AoA reentry with RCS control.
		#autoLOC_501220 = GDLV3
		#autoLOC_501221 = The Generally Designed Launch Vehicle 3 is an adaptable design that the customer can tailor to their needs, in fact the GDLV3 is in such wide use no one can say they actually own it.
		#autoLOC_501222 = Ion-Powered Space Probe
		#autoLOC_501223 = This small probe may look cute and unimpressive, but once it deploys its long-range antenna, it looks pretty much the same.¨¨Its Ion engine is very efficient for a spacecraft this small, so it can go very far indeed, as long as something helps it get into orbit first, of course.
		#autoLOC_501224 = Jumping Flea
		#autoLOC_501225 = The Jumping Flea was originally named after the carnival ride that we salvaged most of its parts from. It might not get us all the way to space, but it will definitely get us started there with a bang!
		#autoLOC_501226 = Kerbal 1-5
		#autoLOC_501227 = A nice little Sunday runabout, the Kerbal 1-5 is just right for day trips to low Kerbin orbit.¨¨This model includes the optional docking port and RCS upgrade package, perfect for joining with your friends in space.
		#autoLOC_501228 = Kerbal 1
		#autoLOC_501229 = An exercise in rocket construction, just right for teaching the basics.¨¨It flies, what more do you need?
		#autoLOC_501230 = Kerbal 2
		#autoLOC_501231 = The Kerbal 2 was built as a 'trainer' rocket. It's not meant to reach very far, but it does feature most of the important systems found in the larger vessels.¨¨It also comes with a parachute. Most astronauts agree that that's one of its best features.
		#autoLOC_501232 = Kerbal X
		#autoLOC_501233 = The Kerbal X is one of the most successful rockets that can be ordered from a catalog. Despite the original design having been meant for a plastic model, it's proved itself quite dependable as a full-sized craft.¨¨The X is capable of achieving orbit around Kerbin, and even features a very optimistic set of landing legs on its upper stage.
		#autoLOC_501234 = Learstar A1
		#autoLOC_501235 = SSTO is overrated, payload capability and comfortable seats are all the rage these days.
		#autoLOC_501236 = Orbiter 1A
		#autoLOC_501237 = The Orbiter 1A is a training craft for orbital maneuvering. Despite not being able to reach orbit on its own, it's a very maneuverable and fun to fly ship once it gets there.
		#autoLOC_501238 = Orbiter One
		#autoLOC_501239 = We're not sure if the engineers named this craft for its series, or for the number of boosters, and our pilots call it "The Unfinished".¨Whatever the reason for the name, it's an interesting craft to fly.
		#autoLOC_501240 = PT Series Munsplorer
		#autoLOC_501241 = PT Munsplorer: No frills super economy class launcher/lander for Mun/Minmus.¨¨Batteries, fins and science sold separately.
		#autoLOC_501242 = Rover + Skycrane
		#autoLOC_501243 = This craft is one of the most ambitious designs found in the Kerlington catalog, especially if one takes the prospect of using it on another planet seriously. ¨¨It requires a launch vehicle to get it into space (and beyond), but its four rockets do have enough thrust for short test runs at the pad.¨¨The operations manual says "approach ground slowly, try not to break the rover when you drop it".
		#autoLOC_501244 = Science Jr
		#autoLOC_501245 = A beginner's experimentation kit, complete with goggles, spatula and launch vehicle.¨¨For ages 3+.
		#autoLOC_501246 = Slim Shuttle
		#autoLOC_501247 = A partially reusable launch system for orbital tourism.
		#autoLOC_501248 = Space Station Core
		#autoLOC_501249 = This Space Station Core shows just how ambitious the Kerlington model rocket catalog can be sometimes. ¨¨If you can manage to build a rocket capable of getting this into orbit, it is air-tight enough to let a few Kerbals live in it for long periods of time. ¨¨It also features a hub with five docking ports, so you can expand your station.
		#autoLOC_501250 = Super-Heavy Lander
		#autoLOC_501251 = This lander may be heavy, but it packs a lot of RCS fuel and has a very funky boarding ladder.¨¨Launch vehicle sold separately.
		#autoLOC_501252 = Two-Stage Lander
		#autoLOC_501253 = Be the first to put a flag up on your favorite moon with this very sensible and mostly-survivable Lander Module.¨¨The first stage is meant to get it down to the surface, and can be jettisoned off for the ascent.¨¨Launch/return vehicle sold separately. Works best at low gravity and with no atmosphere around it.
		#autoLOC_501254 = Viewmatic Survey Satellite
		#autoLOC_501255 = The Viewmatic Survey Satellite was mysteriously found in low orbit around Kerbin. Its original purpose is unknown, but the space center has found it very useful for making sure that their staff are not using company phones for personal use.
		#autoLOC_501256 = Z-MAP Satellite Launch Kit
		#autoLOC_501257 = The Z-Map Satellite kit is a complete spacecraft capable of actually putting its payload into orbit! ¨¨Set includes: Payload satellite with booster stage,¨Liquid-fueled fin-stabilized launcher and two detachable boosters.¨¨Return from orbit not guaranteed. Orbit also not guaranteed. Survival also not guaranteed. Keep out of reach of children and irresponsible adults.
		#autoLOC_501258 = You record the crew's assessment of the situation.
		#autoLOC_501259 = We don't seem to be moving very fast right now.
		#autoLOC_501260 = Reporting in at the Runway. Good thing there's not a lot of air traffic, because I don't think we ever got clearance from the tower to be here.
		#autoLOC_501261 = This is our Space Center. We're home.
		#autoLOC_501262 = Hey, I can see my house from here, I think.
		#autoLOC_501263 = It's very comforting to see that much green below you.
		#autoLOC_501264 = You get a great view of the highlands.
		#autoLOC_501265 = The mountains rise up from the ground of Kerbin. They seem so much smaller from way up here.
		#autoLOC_501266 = The heat rising from the sand causes the desert to move and shimmer.
		#autoLOC_501267 = This looks like a bad place to land.
		#autoLOC_501268 = You see patches of frozen grass. It looks like it's pretty cold out there.
		#autoLOC_501269 = You look down and see a sheet of shining white ice. If you stare at it too long your eyes start to water.
		#autoLOC_501270 = The shores look inviting and you watch the waves roll in to the coast.
		#autoLOC_501271 = From this perspective you can see the underwater topography.
		#autoLOC_501272 = It seems we are very much in space right now. The sky seems to be mostly below us.
		#autoLOC_501273 = Maybe if you get out and push...
		#autoLOC_501274 = It's very... round.
		#autoLOC_501275 = Crew reporting in, from space!
		#autoLOC_501276 = You look down at the cold gray surface. It looks really beat up with craters.
		#autoLOC_501277 = You look at the surface of the Mun and try to find a good landing space. The inside of the craters might be the best option.
		#autoLOC_501278 = The lake beds seem relatively flat, perhaps we could land there.
		#autoLOC_501279 = Looking at the surface of Minmus reminds you of a favorite childhood dessert. You are tempted to taste the surface...
		#autoLOC_501280 = It looks like a particularly lumpy rock. Bet you could jetpack down there.
		#autoLOC_501281 = The planet doesn't appear to have an atmosphere, and you notice darker spots across the surface.
		#autoLOC_501282 = You can't help but notice how incredibly purple the planet is. The shiny oceans are mesmerizing.
		#autoLOC_501283 = The planet is very red, and appears to have deep brown furrows across the surface. There does appear to be some kind of ice at both poles, though.
		#autoLOC_501284 = You can't help but like Ike.
		#autoLOC_501285 = There appear to be some steep, rocky slopes. The higher areas are lighter in color, and the lowlands appear to be very dark gray.
		#autoLOC_501286 = Looking down, you see a massive canyon on the surface. It could be several kilometers deep.
		#autoLOC_501287 = The surface has a patchwork of white and brown areas, with a few craters.
		#autoLOC_501288 = You watch the flowing green storms below, they seem to go on forever, endlessly swirling into each other.
		#autoLOC_501289 = This planet is a wholesome green color. You note down that more planets should be this color.
		#autoLOC_501290 = Laythe looks a lot like Kerbin. You wonder what would happen if you took your helmet off down there.
		#autoLOC_501291 = The surface is mostly covered in oceans. You mark down the landmasses in your report.
		#autoLOC_501292 = The surface has many impressive and jagged mountain ranges. You do not think you'd like to try and land on them.
		#autoLOC_501293 = The moon is mostly white and lighter blue shades. It looks very cold and possibly frozen.
		#autoLOC_501294 = It looks like it would be very hard to land here. It also appears one side is more heavily cratered than the other.
		#autoLOC_501295 = The surface is covered with various shades of white and gray. For a second you thought you saw a face down there...
		#autoLOC_501296 = It appears to be a large brown rock. Perhaps an old asteroid?
		#autoLOC_501297 = As you stare at the planet, something flits by the window. Is there something moving down there?
		#autoLOC_501298 = It looks like a really large grain of pollen. You note down -Pol- in your report.
		#autoLOC_501299 = The terrain below looks very hazardous. You make note of the jagged rocks, inclines and other dangerous areas.
		#autoLOC_501300 = The surface appears to be mostly frozen. You see some interesting brown areas peeking out of the ice and note them in your report.
		#autoLOC_501301 = You search the sky for other nearby planets.  You think Eeloo must be lonely out here by itself. Maybe we should pay it a visit and cheer it up a bit.
		#autoLOC_501302 = You've recorded your observations about the situation.
		#autoLOC_501303 = It's getting very hot in here...
		#autoLOC_501304 = Everything is tinted purple. You feel like you're changing color.
		#autoLOC_501305 = Did you eat too much before you left? You feel so sluggish and heavy...
		#autoLOC_501306 = You can barely move without flying away from the surface. You wish you had brought an anchor.
		#autoLOC_501307 = I don't think a spacesuit was entirely necessary to get here, was it?
		#autoLOC_501308 = You feel kind of small right now... You hope you know where you're going.
		#autoLOC_501309 = This is a most precarious situation.
		#autoLOC_501310 = You're starting to feel you should really get back into the ship.
		#autoLOC_501311 = The dust is getting everywhere!
		#autoLOC_501312 = You look up and search the sky for Kerbin. Suddenly, you feel very small.
		#autoLOC_501313 = You start to say something dramatic and poignant about the plight of Kerbal-kind in this grand universe, only to be cut off by random radio chatter that the situation is nominal.
		#autoLOC_501314 = You're having a bit too much fun with the low gravity.
		#autoLOC_501315 = Is this really a good idea? Staring at the cratered surface below, you're beginning to wonder...
		#autoLOC_501316 = You feel a bit like a superhero when you jump in the low gravity.
		#autoLOC_501317 = After much testing, you determine that red sand castles are plausible.
		#autoLOC_501318 = Everywhere you look, you see red.
		#autoLOC_501319 = You look up at the sky and see something zip past...
		#autoLOC_501320 = There's a bunch of large rocks scattered around the surface. The surface appears to react oddly to light.
		#autoLOC_501321 = When you look closely at the ground, you can see there are many different types of deposits mixed together.
		#autoLOC_501322 = You're not sure how you even landed on the surface of a gas giant. But it's probably best not to think about it for too long.
		#autoLOC_501323 = This place seems nice and comfortable. So comfortable you feel like taking your helmet off. You check the box on your report for -Looks breathable-.
		#autoLOC_501324 = You take your helmet off... After a few long seconds of gasping and haphazardly flailing about you manage to secure your helmet again. You erase the checkbox on your report for breathable atmosphere.
		#autoLOC_501325 = The surface occasionally rumbles beneath you. You think you should probably get back to the ship.
		#autoLOC_501326 = The gravity here is pretty comfortable and reminds you of home. However, the lack of atmosphere is a stark contrast to Kerbin.
		#autoLOC_501327 = The surface is very brown and lumpy. You poke at it with your glove and notice how hard it is.
		#autoLOC_501328 = Everywhere you look it appears the planet is sharp. You don't think you want to sit down or fall on anything.
		#autoLOC_501329 = You lay down and give the planet a hug, just so it knows it's not alone out here.
		#autoLOC_501330 = You Observe the Goo.
		#autoLOC_501331 = The Goo doesn't seem to be doing much right now.
		#autoLOC_501332 = The Goo seems to behave very much the same as it always does around here.
		#autoLOC_501333 = The Goo seems to hate it here.
		#autoLOC_501334 = The Goo escapes into the water!
		#autoLOC_501335 = The Goo wobbles around in its container and starts to seep out of the holes.
		#autoLOC_501336 = The Goo accumulates near the water-facing side of the container.
		#autoLOC_501337 = The Goo seems bored.
		#autoLOC_501338 = The Goo jiggles and wobbles as the craft flies.
		#autoLOC_501339 = The Goo seems to be getting very cold now.
		#autoLOC_501340 = The Goo seems to have clumped into a sphere. It also appears to have become brittle.
		#autoLOC_501341 = The Goo seems to be almost boiling. It writhes around the canister.
		#autoLOC_501342 = The Goo has become rubbery and bounces around the container.
		#autoLOC_501343 = The Goo takes on a purple coloration. Is it just the lighting, or did it change color?
		#autoLOC_501344 = The Goo takes on a red sheen. It looks very much like the planet below.
		#autoLOC_501345 = The Goo seems to be less dense here.
		#autoLOC_501346 = The Goo feels right at home here.
		#autoLOC_501347 = The canister begins to resonate, causing an odd harmonic effect inside the vessel. It's very unsettling.
		#autoLOC_501348 = Gooey tentacles reach out of the canister, freeze, and break off. Fascinating!
		#autoLOC_501349 = While observing the canister, you feel as though something is looking back at you from the shadows of the container.
		#autoLOC_501350 = For a moment the instruments suddenly read off the charts! The container flexes outwards and then settles.
		#autoLOC_501351 = You've collected a sample of the surface.
		#autoLOC_501352 = You dig around in the surface a bit, find something interesting, and throw it into a sample container.
		#autoLOC_501353 = You poke at the ground looking for some really cool rocks to take home.
		#autoLOC_501354 = Yep. Looks like dirt.
		#autoLOC_501355 = This is dirt and grass, and some small rocks. You suspect this isn't going to be much of a groundbreaking discovery.
		#autoLOC_501356 = Here the surface is mostly barren... snow, dirt and rocks. You're very confident that if you looked under the snow, you'd find more dirt and rocks.
		#autoLOC_501357 = Lots of sand and rocks here. You're thankful that you've been in a climate-controlled environment, because it sure looks hot out there. The sand is dry and loose and it looks like it's going to take some effort to clean your gear afterwards.
		#autoLOC_501358 = The ground here seems to be completely frozen. It was very hard to scoop up this sample.
		#autoLOC_501359 = This isn't really solid ground, is it? You got a sample but feared to dig any deeper because of the startling cracking sounds the ice made. You try to not think back on how you landed here.
		#autoLOC_501360 = You took a sample of the soil. It's very muddy and sandy. There might be a body of water nearby.
		#autoLOC_501361 = The grass here is definitely not as green as other places, but the knowledge that you've been at a place called the Badlands makes you feel cool.
		#autoLOC_501362 = You scooped up a sample of the surface. It's a very humid sample.  You hope the equipment has been properly waterproofed.
		#autoLOC_501363 = You've taken a sample of the water. It appears to dramatically increase the surface humidity of anything it touches.
		#autoLOC_501364 = You've taken a sample of the water here. There are bits of vegetation in it, suggesting a strong likelihood that there is land nearby.
		#autoLOC_501365 = The surface is charred and coated with burnt rocket propellant. There are also trace amounts of a conspicuous green substance.
		#autoLOC_501366 = The surface appears to be very hard, like concrete. It might actually be concrete. This could be a very good surface to land at.
		#autoLOC_501367 = This substance is what makes the scientists yell at us when we go into the labs without cleaning our boots first.
		#autoLOC_501368 = The surface appears to be a fine dust with a grey-ish tone. Seems too flaky to make snowballs with.
		#autoLOC_501369 = The darker midlands surface appears to be made up of basaltic rocks.
		#autoLOC_501370 = The sample contains odd glass spherules of various colors. They're quite pretty!
		#autoLOC_501371 = The sample contains evidence of a weak, localized, magnetic field.

		#autoLOC_501373 = The sample contains a combination of breccia and melted materials.
		#autoLOC_501374 = There are higher concentrations of metals in this crater than from other locations.
		#autoLOC_501375 = The ground materials appear to be a combination of basaltic rocks and breccia.
		#autoLOC_501376 = Deeper samples seem to contain more fragmented and shattered formations of rock.
		#autoLOC_501377 = The sample appears to be radioactive.
		#autoLOC_501378 = There appear to be layers of completely different materials here.  It's possible this site has had multiple impacts.
		#autoLOC_501379 = There are large concentrations of melted byproducts here. Some appear to be formed by intense pressures and heat.
		#autoLOC_501380 = Samples from this location appear to be similar in makeup to the powdery surface of the Mun.
		#autoLOC_501381 = Samples in this location are striated. It's possible that the surface has fractured in this location.
		#autoLOC_501382 = Samples from this location seem to show intense shock patterns.
		#autoLOC_501383 = It appears that some of the samples are magnetic and show a faint alignment.
		#autoLOC_501384 = The samples here show lower concentrations of ejecta. There appear to be some liquids in the soil that remain permanently frozen.
		#autoLOC_501385 = Samples seems to contain frozen liquids... We'll need to send them back to Kerbin for further analysis.
		#autoLOC_501386 = The sample appears to be comprised of a large number of materials layered over time.
		#autoLOC_501387 = The sample contains lesser amounts of basaltic rocks. This might account for the changes in coloration we've seen.
		#autoLOC_501388 = The crater seems to contain materials from lower layers of the surface!
		#autoLOC_501389 = These samples appear to be quite old compared to others we've taken.
		#autoLOC_501390 = You sample the dark surface of the crater. This should help determine what type of object hit here.
		#autoLOC_501391 = This crater seems to be filled with useful materials in high concentration. What luck!
		#autoLOC_501392 = The patterning of this surface sample is particularly interesting.
		#autoLOC_501393 = As you sample the crater you can't help but feel bad for the Mun. It's been beaten up pretty bad by these impacts.
		#autoLOC_501394 = You dig around in the surface of the crater, looking for any rocks that look neat.
		#autoLOC_501395 = You find a really cool looking rock and decide to keep it. Remembering that you're supposed to take a surface sample, you throw any old rocks you find into the container. Job done!
		#autoLOC_501396 = Yep, it's a crater all right. You've noted this down on your checklist with a smiley face. Science is fun!
		#autoLOC_501397 = This crater seems to have been a really nasty impact, and the samples are heavier than normal.

		#autoLOC_501457 = One of the samples evaporates when exposed the environment.
		#autoLOC_501458 = The computer gave an odd report no matter how many times we sent the request. Open the sample bay doors... "I'm sorry, I'm afraid I can't let you do that," was the only reply. The doors did open very promptly, however, when we opened the fusebox panel. Very curious.

		#autoLOC_501460 = The samples burn, boil, or crumple under the extreme pressures and heat. The visual camera shows a wonderful rainbow of colors before it cuts out.
		#autoLOC_501461 = You're not sure where the container stops and the samples start anymore...

		#autoLOC_501495 = The atmosphere is very thin here, but it is enough to register on the instrumentation.

		#autoLOC_501689 = As a consequence of a somewhat worse than average accident at [Agency], we've been forced to look for some outside help.
		#autoLOC_501690 = While working late nights, the scientists at [Agency] have made a startling discovery.
		#autoLOC_501691 = While cleaning up after an unintended ignition, one of the overworked teams at [Agency] raised an interesting question.
		#autoLOC_501692 = The board of directors at [Agency] have raised some troubling issues.
		#autoLOC_501693 = The CEO (and chief bottle washer) at [Agency] has stumbled on a problem.
		#autoLOC_501694 = The number of times we've achieved sudden combustion at [Agency] has lead us to consider something.
		#autoLOC_501695 = At [Agency], we're not afraid to try new things. As a result, we sometimes find ourselves in the situation of needing outside help to solve a problem.
		#autoLOC_501696 = We've got some pretty impressive rock collections at [Agency].
		#autoLOC_501697 = [Agency] can think of nothing more prestigious than taking a Kerbal, and leaving them behind on another world.
		#autoLOC_501698 = We have the finest scientific minds working at [Agency], and we've been thinking about giving them something to do.
		#autoLOC_501699 = The research department at [Agency] is very close to figuring out a unified theory of gravioli.
		#autoLOC_501700 = At [Agency], we need brave Kerbals with the right stuff to help achieve our dreams.
		#autoLOC_501701 = One of the founding principles of [Agency] is to continue to advance the frontiers of science.
		#autoLOC_501702 = While hitting parts with a wrench, the engineers at [Agency] realized we had a problem.
		#autoLOC_501703 = We've been reviewing our product catalog at [Agency] and have found an oversight.
		#autoLOC_501704 = We're very proud of our flag at [Agency], and wanted to do something special with it.
		#autoLOC_501705 = As part of [Agency]'s commitment to strong corporate statements, we've been looking for ways to get our brand out there.
		#autoLOC_501706 = At [Agency], we're Kerbal enough to admit when mistakes are made. This is one of those times.
		#autoLOC_501707 = We're not usually in the habit of misplacing things at [Agency], but we may have lost something big.
		#autoLOC_501708 = We're constantly looking for how to make better use of satellites at [Agency].
		#autoLOC_501709 = As a result of some surplus parts at the [Agency] warehouses, we've got some more opportunities for orbital satellites.
		#autoLOC_501710 = To meet our quota of "useful things in space", we've been looking into station building projects at [Agency].
		#autoLOC_501711 = We've been poring over maps at the [Agency] offices looking for points of interest, and may have come up with something.
		#autoLOC_501712 = While using the [Agency] dart board as a waypoint planner, we've come up with something interesting.
		#autoLOC_501713 = We're always looking for new revenue streams at [Agency]. Our accountants have told us that space tourism is a growth industry and we'd like to get in on it.
		#autoLOC_501714 = We may have underestimated just how volatile solid rocket fuel really is, and have now found ourselves with a problem we can't solve on our own.
		#autoLOC_501715 = To test out some of our more advanced theories, we need more debris in low orbit.
		#autoLOC_501716 = We're not sure if there really is such a thing as too many struts, but we'd like to find out.
		#autoLOC_501717 = We're trying to figure out if all matter in the universe is as dense as on Kerbin, but haven't come up with a conclusive test for it.
		#autoLOC_501718 = We want to know what shades of green we'll see if we expose a Kerbal to high gee forces.
		#autoLOC_501719 = There are fewer asteroids in orbit of [Topic] than the standard model would predict.
		#autoLOC_501720 = We believe that an asteroid in orbit of [Topic] is worth two in space, and would like to prove it.
		#autoLOC_501721 = We'd like to run some experiments on the feasibility of long-term Kerbal habitation outside of Kerbin as part of the [Topic] project.
		#autoLOC_501722 = We need someone to apply the scientific method... in space!
		#autoLOC_501723 = We're looking for some scientific data. We'd really prefer some new data, but we'd be really happy with any data at all, really.
		#autoLOC_501724 = We have some forms to fill out, and we're pretty sure it would be way more interesting if we filled it out using science data from space.
		#autoLOC_501725 = Our science containers are all empty, and nobody wants to run out to another biome to fill one.
		#autoLOC_501726 = We still have unchecked items on our list of records to break and would like to change that.
		#autoLOC_501727 = Nobody has set any space records yet! It would probably be best to just start by getting something off the launchpad. Then we can start worrying about things like "survivability".
		#autoLOC_501728 = The problem is that we don't actually have any idea how difficult it is to get a Kerbal to orbit, and we need to find out quickly.
		#autoLOC_501729 = We want to know how many planets we can send a Kerbal to before they start ignoring us and fly the ship back.
		#autoLOC_501730 = We're trying to assemble an interplanetary color wheel, and need someone to verify it against a few different celestial bodies.
		#autoLOC_501731 = We're not saying that there are aliens on another planet in our solar system, but... aliens.
		#autoLOC_501732 = We'd like to know if getting [Topic] from somewhere other than Kerbin is as easy as taking snacks from a juvenile Kerbal.
		#autoLOC_501733 = We think that we can prove that there's an abundance of [Topic] throughout the solar system.
		#autoLOC_501734 = There is very little knowledge about how the [Topic] performs under conditions not found in a standard laboratory.
		#autoLOC_501735 = The manual clearly states that the [Topic] is the best in its class. To avoid legal complications, we're going to need proof to justify our claims.
		#autoLOC_501736 = We have way too many parts like the [Topic], and nobody's sure how they work.
		#autoLOC_501737 = We don't actually know how to attach a [Topic] to other parts. From the bottom? The top? Is there even a way to tell which side is up?
		#autoLOC_501738 = If we could have our flag proudly standing on the surface of [Topic], we would surely prove ourselves better than the competition.
		#autoLOC_501739 = We want to verify that a flag planted by an astronaut is the best way to test the rigidity of the surface of [Topic].
		#autoLOC_501740 = We think that the aesthetic of [Topic] would be greatly improved with just one more flag, but we're not able to get one there ourselves.
		#autoLOC_501741 = Apparently, using crewed craft is not a good way to test theories on the dangers of space junk. If you could bring [Topic] back home, we promise not to leave anyone else up there.
		#autoLOC_501742 = We've lost a Kerbal! Could you find [Topic] for us? Their snack supplies may be starting to run a little low.
		#autoLOC_501743 = We've been performing a lot of experiments with leaving Kerbals in space for extended periods of time. Things were going great, until [Topic] woke up one morning and decided to walk out of their capsule.
		#autoLOC_501744 = So apparently, [Topic] is having a lot of trouble with their EVA jetpack. So much so that the rest of the crew may have forgotten to wait for them to get back to the capsule, resulting in them being left in orbit.
		#autoLOC_501745 = We've been experimenting with methods of calculating delta-v without a Kerbal on board (a "Mechanical Bill Kerman" of sorts) and have run into some trouble. The problem being that we can't seem to get [Topic] back to Kerbin.
		#autoLOC_501746 = We've been experimenting with methods of calculating orbital information without a Kerbal on board (a "Jebediah's Engineer" of sorts) and have run into some trouble. The problem being that we can't seem to get [Topic] back to Kerbin.
		#autoLOC_501747 = We've got a competition to see which agency can get the most satellites in particular orbits, and would like some assistance.
		#autoLOC_501748 = We want to be a part of building some really big space stations, and the [Topic] project is a great opportunity.
		#autoLOC_501749 = We don't know too many interesting things about [Topic], and would like to take a look around.
		#autoLOC_501750 = Some Kerbals say that every place on [Topic] looks exactly the same. We disagree, but need someome else to prove them wrong.
		#autoLOC_501751 = We want to know if there are Kerbals that will really pay for the extra seats that you surely already have on your craft.
		#autoLOC_501752 = To get to orbit, we think all we need is for a Kerbal with terrible aim to shoot for the ground and miss.
		#autoLOC_501753 = We want to know if it's as fun as it seems to be in zero-G.
		#autoLOC_501754 = We aren't sure if a day on Kerbin is 6 or 24 hours long.
		#autoLOC_501755 = We'd like to check if Kerbin is in fact perfectly round, and not an oblate spheroid as some lunatics suggest.
		#autoLOC_501756 = We want to know if going to the Mun is a good idea or not.
		#autoLOC_501757 = We need to know if Mun Pies would really sell (what a time to be alive!).
		#autoLOC_501758 = There's no way for us to know if the surface of the Mun is as pretty as everyone thinks.
		#autoLOC_501759 = We want to know if Minmus is really a myth or not.
		#autoLOC_501760 = We're not sure how pretty Minmus is up close.
		#autoLOC_501761 = We need to know if Minmus Mint Chip ice cream would really sell.
		#autoLOC_501762 = We believe that it would be a lot of fun to jump around on Minmus.
		#autoLOC_501763 = If the surface of Minmus isn't edible, will Kerbals still try to eat it?
		#autoLOC_501764 = How far does something that goes up have to go before it doesn't come down again?
		#autoLOC_501765 = We suspect that there's interesting places to see beyond Kerbin and all its moons, although we suspect there's a lot of empty space in between.
		#autoLOC_501766 = Now we need your help.
		#autoLOC_501767 = This is why we're here.
		#autoLOC_501768 = So this is where you come in.
		#autoLOC_501769 = We believe that you are much better positioned to deal with this than us.
		#autoLOC_501770 = So please get us an asteroid, but watch out with that claw.
		#autoLOC_501771 = We need you to science the... Kerbal out of this.
		#autoLOC_501772 = So if you could point some of those satellites our way, we'd be rather pleased.
		#autoLOC_501773 = But really, there's no sense in us still talking while there's science to be done. Shall we get to it?
		#autoLOC_501774 = It's time for you to take another step in advancing the frontier.
		#autoLOC_501775 = So, when can we expect the first shipment?
		#autoLOC_501776 = So we need a few simple tests run for us.
		#autoLOC_501777 = It would really help us out if you're able to run a test.
		#autoLOC_501778 = So, up for planting a flag?
		#autoLOC_501779 = We'd be quite grateful if you could perform this recovery operation for us.
		#autoLOC_501780 = So, can you take a few extra Kerbals with you on your next flight?
